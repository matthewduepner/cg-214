            <p>
                Charles Ormond Eames, Jr (1907–1978) and Bernice Alexandra "Ray" (née Kaiser) Eames (1912–1988) were husband and wife American designers who made significant historical contributions to the development of modern architecture and furniture. Among their most well-known designs is the Eames Lounge Chair. They also worked in the fields of industrial and graphic design, fine art and film. The Eameses pioneered technologies, such as fiberglass furniture, plastic resin chairs, and the wire mesh chairs designed for Herman Miller.

            <h2>Harry Bertoia</h2>
            <!--<p>
                Harry Bertoia (March 10, 1915 – November 6, 1978) was an Italian-born American artist and modern furniture designer.  At the age of 15, given the choice to stay in drought ridden Italy or move to Detroit, Harry chose to adventure to America and live with his older brother, Oreste. He soon enrolled in Cass Technical High School, where he studied art and design and learned the skill of handmade jewelry making. In 1936 he attended the Art School of the Detroit Society of Arts and Crafts, now known as the College for Creative Studies. The following year in 1937 he received a scholarship to study at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he encountered Walter Gropius, Edmund N. Bacon and <strong>Ray and Charles Eames</strong> and Florence Knoll for the first time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bertoia taught jewelry design and metal work at Cranbrook until all the metal was taken up by war efforts.  He then became the graphics instructor. In 1943, he married Brigitta Valentiner and moved to California to work for Charles and Ray at the Molded Plywood Division of the Evans Product Company. Bertoia worked there until 1946, then sold his jewelry and monotypes until obtaining work with the Electronics Naval Lab in La Jolla. In 1950, he was invited to move to Pennsylvania to work with Hans and Florence Knoll. (Florence was also a Cranbrook Graduate.) During this period he designed his most famous works, five wire pieces that became known as the Bertoia Collection for Knoll. Among these was the famous diamond chair, a fluid, sculptural form made from a welded lattice work of steel.

            <h2>Gretta Grossman</h2>
            <p>
                Greta Magnusson-Grossman (1906–1999) was a Swedish furniture designer, interior designer, and architect. She was one of the few female designers to gain prominence during the mid-20th century architectural scene in Los Angeles. Her early exposure to European Modernism deeply influenced her later architectural work, seen as a synthesis of European ideals and the culture and lifestyle of Southern California.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1940, in the midst of World War II, she left Sweden and moved with her husband to Los Angeles where they opened the Magnussen-Grossman Studio on Rodeo Drive. The studio focused on furniture and lighting design and sold to several well-known furniture companies such as Sherman Bertram, Martin Brattrud, Cal-Mode and Barker Brothers' Modern Shop. Her furniture is characterized by its unique mixture of materials and slender proportions Her work attracted Hollywood clientele, and she designed interiors for stars such as Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman.

            <h2>Arne Jacobsen</h2>
            <p>
                Arne Emil Jacobsen (1902–1971) was a Danish architect and designer. He is remembered for his contribution to architectural Functionalism as well as for the worldwide success he enjoyed with simple but effective chair designs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Arne Jacobsen is remembered primarily for his furniture designs. However, he believed he was first and foremost an architect and never used the word 'designer', notoriously disliking it. In fact, most of his designs were created for architectural projects. A vast majority of his furniture designs were the result of a cooperation with the furniture manufacturer Fritz Hansen with which he initiated a collaboration in 1934 while his lamps and light fixtures were developed with Louis Poulsen.
