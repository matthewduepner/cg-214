        <h1>CG-214 Midterm Project Proposal</h1>
        <div class="proposal_1">
            <p>For my midterm project, I will be making an online resume/portfolio.  The webpage will consist of the following three pages: an image gallery containing all of my best work with brief descriptions of each piece, a nicely formated text based resume with appropriate links, and a collection of all the articles and videos I have appeared in.</p>
            <p>To showcase my work as best as possible, I will focus a great deal on designing the site, so it is as intuitive and unobtrusive as possible.  I want people to focus on the quality of my work, not get distracted by a poorly constructed website. As such, I will explore ways to display my work in a compact manner while still showcasing all of the details.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="proposal_2">
            <p>In case the project outlined above does not meet the midterm requirements, I am equally comfortable making a webpage exploring mid-century modern furniture and lighting. I’m currently working a part time job at a furniture store, so the research required to complete this assignment will likely help me become a better salesman. The website will contain the following three pages: the history surrounding and development of mid-century modern design, accomplished furniture designers from this era and some of their iconic pieces, accomplished lighting designers from this era and some of their iconic pieces. I have learned from experience that it is much easier to sell something when you are knowledgeable about the product.  Consequently, should this project be chosen instead of my original idea, then I intend for it to serve as a potential guide for anyone looking to sell mid-century modern furniture and or lighting.</p>
